### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer from the Netherlands always interested in learning new skills.
A few of the projects I've worked on:
- [Autorank](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/autorank.44752/): a project to provide Minecraft servers with tools to automatically rank their players;
- [Solar Team Eindhoven](https://www.flickr.com/photos/solarteameindhoven/52162634399/): building my own solar car and race it across the Australian outback in 2019!
- [Lightyear](https://lightyear.one/): bringing to market the first commercially available solar electric vehicle
- The [NOS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nos.app&hl=nl) and [Jeugdjournaal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nos.jeugdjournaal&hl=nl) (Youth news) apps in the Netherlands

In my free time, I work on building software that is as intuitive as possible and allows other developers to integrate it into their tools! While I'm not an embedded engineer, I enjoy learning
about new programming languages and concepts!

My To-do list:
- Learn and build my first tool in Rust (🛠️)
- Become an expert in refactoring
- Automate my home (🏡) to the max with Home Assistant

Oh, and of course: 🐶 (dogs) > 😾 (cats)
